%% Spherical Functions
%
% The |S2Fun| toolbox is a collection of Matlab classes for numerical computations with functions on the two-dimensional sphere.
% It overloads the default commands for vectors and matrices to compute the analogous operations for functions of the given type.
% The underlying mathematical approach is accomplished via spherical harmonics which form an orthonormal basis of the square-integrable functions on the two-dimensional sphere.
